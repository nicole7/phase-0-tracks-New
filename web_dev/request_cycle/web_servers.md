2. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
- Small is beautiful and Each program does one thing well
- Choose portability over efficiency
- Store data in flat text files
- Use software leverage
- Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability
- Avoid Captive User Interface
- Make every program a filter

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
- Runs a copy of an operating system. Right now, I have 
  Linux on as a VM on my computer. When I log into it, I have all the access a Linux user would have and it runs like another computer inside my own. It doesn't communicate with my computer's files and information. VPS runs on another computer. 
- Advantages include better reliability, control over 
  entire server, efficiency and more green platform, expand resources if needed and save money

Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
- From my undestanding, it's similar to why you wouldn't 
  want to work diectly on the master directory in your terminal for Github. Any mistakes any issues will be on the main file. It's better to have work done as another user to dimish any damaging changes directly to the main source.
