I know that W3Schools has a good walk through of jQuery 
it can be extensive so I will look over the different
sections to get my feet wet. Then I'm going to find videos
and other walk throughs to get a better sense. After an hour
I find it's good to take a 15 minute break and then the second 
hour. I am also going to find a cheat sheet, recommendations
online and then try it out in repl.it
