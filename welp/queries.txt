2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT users.id, users.firstname, users.lastname, businesses.id, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;
1|Bradford|Pitt|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|Great place!
2|Mandy|Kaling|2|Amir's Towing|1|Wasn't pleased...
3|Angela|Jolia|3|The Beagle Nightclub|5|Top notch!!



3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT users.firstname, users.lastname, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;
Bradford|Pitt|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|Great place!
Mandy|Kaling|Amir's Towing|1|Wasn't pleased...
Angela|Jolia|The Beagle Nightclub|5|Top notch!!



4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

sqlite> SELECT users.id, users.firstname, users.lastname, businesses.id, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id WHERE businesses.name = "Amir's Towing"

Come up with an example of a real-world many-to-many relationship. Using whatever medium you prefer (online diagramming tool, pen and paper, etc.), draw a schema showing how you would set up this many-to-many relationship in a database.

Students                        Major                           University
id (integer primary key)__      id (integer primary key)   _____id (integer primary key)
first_name(varchar 255)   \		major(varchar 255)        /     name (varchar 255)
last_name(varchar 255)     \	gpa (int)                /
						   	\___student_id (int)        /
						   	    university_id (int)____/
