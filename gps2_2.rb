#Refelct:
#From pseudocode, I learned that it is much easier to write out essentially directions of what you need to do 
#and then go back and just fill it in with code. It's more time efficient

#Using arrays and hashes mak it easier to store information and pass it to another method
#It's also easier to change the data when you can iterate thru it with an array or hash

#A method returns an object but not something you can really work with.
#You have call the method and store the returned object in a varibale and use that variable

#You can pass integers, string, floats, booleans, arrays, hashes and other methods. So pretty much almost anything

#You can call a method within another method. You can retrn from one method and store it in a variable to be passed as 
#an argument into another method
#You can also pass a method within another methods arguement

#The concepts of how methods work and how to use return values were solidified.
#Also, I got some clarification on hashes and arrays but I'm still not there with completely understanding it
#It's still hard when I need to compare/manipulate a hash with an array or an array with a string. As
#each have their own methods and behaviors, I get confused on how to make the change I want
