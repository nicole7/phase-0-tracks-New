1. Why are data structures useful in programming?
	- Data structures can store multiple types of data which makes it easier to organize smaller, related pieces of information. 
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.
	- An array is a list of elements of the same data type. All elements are the same size but can be different values
3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.
	- A grocery list or a list of ingredients
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.
	-A collection of key-value pairs. Indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object
	-Enumerate their values in the order that the corresponding keys were inserted
5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.
	- Student grades where the key is the student and the value is their grade. 
	- A classroom where the keys are the desks and the values are the supplies within the desk and their amounts
6. Why is iteration useful?
	- It is used to repeat a process in a loop. It can be helpful when trying to go through each item in an array or hash either to get or change data 
7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.
	- If you needed to update a website with student grades, you can iterate through a list of percentages and print them out one by one for the students to see
8. What is a block?
	-Some portable code that makes up its own little mini program
	- A block parameter is a place holder that the argument will pass through. the value comes from the arguement itself which is obtained locally outside of the block method
