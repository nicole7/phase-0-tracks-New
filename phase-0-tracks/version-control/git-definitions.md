# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* What is a merge conflict?

1. Version Control is something that allows you to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and merge revisions made by different people
   It's useful because you essentially have a timeline of edits made, who made the edits and see were any mistakes were made

2. A branch shows you the last commit you made - usually master
   And you would use one because it essentially shows you where you/another person left off

3. A commit are save points in Git
   A good commit message has a unique ID, a message, an author and a timestamp

4. A merge conflict is when two or more branches change the same thing in a file and then get merged
