1. Tells the browser to process the code in html5. Thos most useful one 
I saw was <DOCTYPE! html> because it completely changed the behavior and
was better recognized in the validator. 
2. Top to bottom
3. That it can create snippets that create shortcuts to make coding easier.
You can even make your own. I will definitly use this tool.
4. The biggest challenge is remembering the difference between the different
"containers" you can add to your html. The guide sent me a really good 
website that showed how they are correlate with each other. I'm planning on 
taking notes, bookmarking useful websites and making flashcards if needed.
